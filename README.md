# Further Reading
 
Often when I'm reading an article it will contain links to to other pages I would like to read next. I would open the links while I'm reading the article and then inevitably have to bookmark them because I donâ€™t have time to finish reading them at that time. This browser extension gathers all hyperlinks from the page, creates a bookmark folder with the title of the page, and bookmarks all the links on the page in that folder.

To save all the links on a page, just run the extension (click on it or press Ctrl+Shift+U). A folder with the title of the page will be created in the "Other Bookmarks" folder and all the links from the page will be bookmarked in that folder.

It currently only works for Firefox but I may add compatibility for other browsers.
